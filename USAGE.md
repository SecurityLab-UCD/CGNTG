# Usage
## 🔧 Build Pre-requisites

### 1. 🐳Using Docker (Recommend)
You can use the [Dockerfile](Docekrfile) to build the environment:
```
docker build -t promptfuzz .
docker run -it promptfuzz bash
```

### 2. Library build scripts
Before you use this tool for a new project, you **must** have a automatic build
script to build your project to prepare the required data (e.g., headers, link
libraries, test data and etc.), like
[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz). See
[Preparation](data/README.md).

We have prepared the build scripts for some popular open source libraries, you
can refer to the **data** directory.


### 3. Build Environment Locally (Optional)
If you prefer to set up the environment locally instead of using Docker, you can follow the instructions below:

**Requirements:**
- Rust stable
- LLVM and Clang (built with compiler-rt)
- wllvm (installed by `pip3 install wllvm`)

You can download llvm and clang from this
[link](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-15.0.0) or
install by [llvm.sh](https://apt.llvm.org/).

Explicit dependency see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

If you prefer build llvm manually, you can build clang with compiler-rt and libcxx from source code following the config:
```
cmake -S llvm -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld" \
 -DLLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES="libcxx;libcxxabi;compiler-rt;" \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLIBCXX_ENABLE_STATIC_ABI_LIBRARY=ON \
 -DLIBCXXABI_ENABLE_SHARED=OFF  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ 
 ```

## 🦄Basic Usage

### 1. Build library
Run the script in the **promptfuzz/data** directory, to prepare the required data of this library.

After the build process is finished, the data of this library is stored under **promptfuzz/output/build/**.

### 2. Export LLM Service Environments
CNTG use OPENAI API as the backend LLM service interfaces, and you need to set up the following environment variables to access your LLM service:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your LLM service access key.
- `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`: Your LLM service model name.
- `OPENAI_PROXY_BASE` (Optional): Your LLM service address.
- `OPENAI_INPUT_PRICE` (Optional): The cost of a single prompt.
- `OPENAI_OUTPUT_PRICE` (Optional): The cost of a single output.
- `OPENAI_CONTEXT_LIMIT` (Optional): The maximum number of tokens that can be generated by the LLM service.

You must set your API key and the model name in the environment variable:
```
user@ubuntu$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(your_key)
user@ubuntu$ export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=$(your_model_name)
```

If you want to use a proxy server to access the LLM service, you can set the following environment variable:
```
user@ubuntu$ export OPENAI_PROXY_BASE=https://openai.proxy.com/v1
```

> If you need to run CNTG on your local models, you should use [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or other inference engines to deploy your LLM service first.

### 4. Generate seeds

CNTG generates API sequences. There are several options that can be tuned in the configuration.

Typically, the only options that need to be actively set are `-c` and `-r`. The
`-c` option determines the number of cores to be used for sanitization. Enabling
the `-r` option will periodically re-check the correctness of the seed programs,
reducing false positives but also introducing some extra overhead.

For instance, the following command is sufficient to generate API sequences for
zlib
```
cd /data/zlib

./build.sh

export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"
cargo run --bin fuzzer -- zlib -c $(nproc) -r
```

### 5. Benchmarking API Combinations

Once the API sequences are generated, you can fuse them into a single executable and collect coverage to benchmark the effectiveness of the generated API combinations.

Take `zlib` as an example. You can run this command to fuse the programs into a single executable:

`cargo run --bin harness -- zlib fuse-seeds`

And then, you can collect the coverage of the fused program:

`cargo run --bin harness -- zlib collect-coverage`

To get a human-readable coverage report, you can use the `report-cntg` command. This command will first collect the coverage and then generate a report.

`cargo run --bin harness -- zlib report-coverage`
